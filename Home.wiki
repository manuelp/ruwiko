= RuWiKo =
This is a [[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiWeb|wiki]] site compiled using **RuWiKo** (Ruby Wiki Kompiler): a static wiki generator. You can write a wiki with your favorite text editor as a set of text files in your filesystem and compile it to a static site with a single command.

I chosen the name based on its "Japanese feel".

== Features ==
* [[http://www.wikicreole.org/wiki/Creole1.0|Creole 1.0]] markup (extended)
* Presentation completely personalizable

== Requirements ==
* Ruby 1.9
* [[http://github.com/gmccreight/wikicreole|WikiCreole]]

== Installation ==
When you have all the requirements, you only need to download this repository. For this step you have two options:

* Download an archive of the last version of //RuWiKo// from  [[http://bitbucket.org/manuelp/ruwiko/downloads/|here]].
* Use [[http://mercurial.selenic.com/|Mercurial]] to download (and stay up-to-date) the last version:

{{{
hg clone http://bitbucket.org/manuelp/ruwiko
}}}

== Usage ==
Simply write as many //*.wiki// files as you wish using the [[http://www.wikicreole.org/wiki/Creole1.0|Creole]] syntax in the //RuWiKo// directory, then run the //compile.rb// program:

{{{
ruby compile.rb
}}}

All the compiled wiki pages and the CSS files will be placed under the //html// subdirectory.
